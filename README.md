| :bangbang: | This repository is <ins>currently under development</ins> and does not have a stable version, so it is possible that there are bugs and I'm still making fixes and improvements until the [first release](https://github.com/EasyXploit/HelpBot/releases). |

## About
[**HelpBot**](https://github.com/EasyXploit/HelpBot) is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) self-hosted bot designed to run on a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) server, whose main functions are automated community moderation, leveling, chat utilities and much more!<br /><br />
This project was born out of curiosity, as a way to give form to the knowledge about [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) that I acquired during a Professional Formation course that I was doing, but that over time has made me discover that I am passionate about programming.<br /><br />
Given that initially it was a project with quite unstable knowledge bases, the code has undergone several refactorings until reaching this point, from which I have decided that I'm going to make it [open source](https://opensource.com/) under an [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), and continue with it's development and work on other related projects.<br /><br />
Due to this, the bot has **NOT** been designed from the beginning to work in more than one Discord community ([guild](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild)) at the same time, so the bot does not have a database system, and instead works with [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) files.<br /><br />


> **NOTICE:**<br />
The bot code is <ins>excessively full of comments</ins> (in Spanish), because it is a learning project and my goal in doing this was to understand at all times what I was programming, and to easily recover the thread (the old commits, issues and projects were also written in Spanish).

* Thanks to my programming teacher María José Lozano, for teaching me the basics of JavaScript and how to think like a programmer. Without her lessons, I probably would not have started this project.
* Thanks to the [supported languages](https://github.com/EasyXploit/HelpBot/wiki/Translation#supported-languages) translators who make this repository accessible to many more people.
* Thanks to the community of [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), who have always been there to answer all my questions about the library, and that they constantly work to cover the 100% of the API.<br />
